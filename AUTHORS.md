The `readimc` package was developed by [Jonas Windhager](mailto:jonas@windhager.io) based on existing functionality implemented in [imctools](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imctools), which was originally created by Vito Zanotelli and Anton Rau.

It was maintained by Jonas Windhager until February 2023 and is currently maintained by [Milad Adibi](mailto:milad.adibi@uzh.ch).
