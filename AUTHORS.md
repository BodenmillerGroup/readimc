The `readimc` package was developed by [Jonas Windhager](mailto:jonas@windhager.io)
based on existing functionality implemented in
[imctools](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imctools), which was originally created
by [Vito Zanotelli](mailto:vito.zanotelli@uzh.ch) and
[Anton Rau](mailto:anton.rau@uzh.ch).

The `readimc` package is currently maintained by
