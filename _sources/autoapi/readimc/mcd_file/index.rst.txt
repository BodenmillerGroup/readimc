   readimc.mcd_file.MCDFile




.. py:class:: MCDFile(path)

   Bases: :py:obj:`readimc.imc_file.IMCFile`

   A class for reading IMC .mcd files

   :param path: path to the IMC .mcd file

   .. py:property:: schema_xml
      :type: str

      Full metadata in proprietary XML format


   .. py:property:: metadata
      :type: str

      Legacy accessor for `schema_xml`


   .. py:property:: slides
      :type: Sequence[readimc.data.Slide]

      Metadata on slides contained in this IMC .mcd file


   .. py:property:: path
      :type: pathlib.Path

      Path to the IMC file


   .. py:method:: open()

      Opens the IMC .mcd file for reading.

      It is good practice to use context managers whenever possible:

      .. code-block:: python

          with MCDFile("/path/to/file.mcd") as f:
              pass



   .. py:method:: close()

      Closes the IMC .mcd file.

      It is good practice to use context managers whenever possible:

      .. code-block:: python

          with MCDFile("/path/to/file.mcd") as f:
              pass



   .. py:method:: read_acquisition(acquisition = None)

      Reads IMC acquisition data as numpy array.

      :param acquisition: the acquisition to read
      :return: the acquisition data as 32-bit floating point array,
          shape: (c, y, x)


   .. py:method:: read_slide(slide)

      Reads and decodes a slide image as numpy array using the ``imageio``
      package.

      .. note::
          Slide images are stored as binary data within the IMC .mcd file in
          an arbitrary encoding. The ``imageio`` package can decode most
          commonly used image file formats, but may fail for more obscure,
          in which case an ``IOException`` is raised.

      :param slide: the slide to read
      :return: the slide image, or ``None`` if no image is available for the
          specified slide


   .. py:method:: read_panorama(panorama)

      Reads and decodes a panorama image as numpy array using the
      ``imageio`` package.

      :param panorama: the panorama to read
      :return: the panorama image as numpy array


   .. py:method:: read_before_ablation_image(acquisition)

      Reads and decodes a before-ablation image as numpy array using the
      ``imageio`` package.

      :param acquisition: the acquisition for which to read the
          before-ablation image
      :return: the before-ablation image as numpy array, or ``None`` if no
          before-ablation image is available for the specified acquisition


   .. py:method:: read_after_ablation_image(acquisition)

      Reads and decodes a after-ablation image as numpy array using the
      ``imageio`` package.

      :param acquisition: the acquisition for which to read the
          after-ablation image
      :return: the after-ablation image as numpy array, or ``None`` if no
          after-ablation image is available for the specified acquisition
